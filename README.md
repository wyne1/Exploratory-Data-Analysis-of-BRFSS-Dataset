#### This project was the final graded project of the Introduction to Probability and Data course by Duke University on Coursera. The course is part of the specialization "Statistics with R". 
#### There were 3 Research questions that we were supposed to come up with and perform EDA using the BRFSS dataset. The research questions I formulated are:

> #### Research Question 1: Is the respondents opinion about their health status related to the fact that they smoke? Are the observation similar between genders?

> #### Research Question 2: Does education have a significant impact on the salaries and employment status of individuals? How is it different among men and women?

> #### Research Question 3: Does employment have any impact on the mental health of individuals? In other words, deos job/salary have any relation with individuals feeling depressed, nervous, or restless? Is the observation similar between genders
