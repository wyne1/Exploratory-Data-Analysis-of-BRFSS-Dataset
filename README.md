# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-BRFSS-Dataset

***

#### This project was the final graded project of the Introduction to Probability and Data course by Duke University on Coursera. The course is part of the specialization "Statistics with R". 

#### There were 3 Research questions that we were supposed to come up with and perform EDA using the BRFSS dataset. The research questions I formulated are:

> #### Research Question 1: Is the respondents opinion about their health status related to the fact that they smoke? Are the observation similar between genders?

> #### Research Question 2: Does education have a significant impact on the salaries and employment status of individuals? How is it different among men and women?

> #### Research Question 3: Does employment have any impact on the mental health of individuals? In other words, deos job/salary have any relation with individuals feeling depressed, nervous, or restless? Is the observation similar between genders

## Data

### BRFSS Background

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the  system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The CDC official website statest that, "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation’s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world."

### How they collect data
“BRFSS is a cross-sectional telephone survey that state health departments conduct monthly over landline telephones and cellular telephones with a standardized questionnaire and technical and methodological assistance from CDC. In conducting the BRFSS landline telephone survey, interviewers collect data from a randomly selected adult in a household. In conducting the cellular telephone version of the BRFSS questionnaire, interviewers collect data from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing.”

### Generalizability & Causality
Before jumping into the exploratory analysis of the BRFSS data, we need to establish our understanding on the generalizability and causality within the data.

  - The data can be generalized to the broader US population since the surveys are conducted across all 50 US states, which means it captures enough random sample.</p>
  - No causality because the BRFSS is an observational exercise - with no explicit random assignments to treatments - all relationships indicated may indication association, but not causation.
